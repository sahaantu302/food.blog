            <p>I am a food blogger. Food is my best friend, the kind of friend that has never hurt me, except for a few
                times, when I had
                eaten so much that I thought my tummy would burst.My adventures with food will continue to be wilder and
                more satisfying!</p><br><br>

            <h1>My Recipies</h1>
            <p>Everyone has a hobby and so do I. My hobby is cooking. I love to cook. At first, I used to help my mom in
                her cooking. But later I found that I really enjoy cooking. I asked my mom to teach me that, and she was
                really happy about this.
                Then she teaches me and I learned pretty much everything about cooking.</p>
